# üì° WiFi Network Analyzer

A powerful Python-based tool for scanning, monitoring, and detecting vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks. It can identify rogue access points, MAC spoofing, and deauthentication attacks in real-time, helping users secure their wireless environment.

---

## üõ† Features

- üîç **Wi-Fi Scanner**: Lists nearby networks with SSID, BSSID, signal strength, and security status.
- üö® **Rogue AP Detection**: Identifies unauthorized access points spoofing legitimate SSIDs.
- üé≠ **MAC Spoofing Detection**: Detects devices with duplicate MAC addresses using different IPs.
- ‚ö° **Deauthentication Attack Detection**: Real-time monitoring for deauth packets using Scapy.
- üíæ **CSV Logging**: Saves all scan and detection results for future analysis.

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- [PyWiFi](https://github.com/awkman/pywifi)
- [Scapy](https://scapy.net/)
- Built-in libraries: `csv`, `os`, `logging`, `smtplib`, `time`

## üì¶ Installation

> **Note**: Some features require root/administrator privileges and a compatible wireless adapter in monitor mode.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wifi-network-analyzer.git
   cd wifi-network-analyzer
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pywifi scapy
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   sudo python3 analyzer.py
   ```

---

## üöÄ Usage

The script will:

* Scan nearby Wi-Fi networks
* Detect rogue access points based on preconfigured trusted networks
* Scan the local network for IP-MAC mapping
* Detect MAC spoofing
* Start real-time monitoring for deauthentication attacks

All results will be saved as CSV files:

* `wifi_scan_results.csv`
* `rogue_aps.csv`
* `mac_spoofing.csv`
* `deauth_attacks.csv`

---

## üõ° Trusted Network Configuration

Update the known network dictionary in the `detect_rogue_ap()` function:

```python
known_networks = {
    "YourSSID": "00:11:22:33:44:55"
}
```
